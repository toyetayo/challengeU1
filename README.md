 ***Ghosts Ruby Script***
This Ruby script demonstrates how to create an array of hashes and iterate through each hash to print specific details. The script provides information about four different "ghosts", including their names, ages, interests, and net worth.

The script defines an array of hashes named `ghosts`. Each hash contains the following keys: `:name`, `:age`, `:loves`, and `:net_worth`.

The script iterates through the `ghosts` array and constructs a sentence with the information from each hash, then prints this sentence to the console.
