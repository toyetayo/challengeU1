# ** Carl Sagan Ruby Script **

The script defines two main data structures:

1. A hash `carl` with keys `:toast`, `:punctuation`, and `:words`.
2. An array `sagan` containing various elements, including hashes and a string.


# ** Ghosts Ruby Script **
This Ruby script demonstrates how to create an array of hashes and iterate through each hash to print specific details. The script provides information about four different "ghosts", including their names, ages, interests, and net worth.

The script defines an array of hashes named `ghosts`. Each hash contains the following keys: `:name`, `:age`, `:loves`, and `:net_worth`.

The script iterates through the `ghosts` array and constructs a sentence with the information from each hash, then prints this sentence to the console.

# Dog Breeds and Sub-Breeds List
This Ruby script retrieves a list of dog breeds and their sub-breeds from the dog.ceo API and prints them in a nicely formatted list.

The script uses the `net/http` and `json` libraries to make a GET request to the dog.ceo API and parse the response.
